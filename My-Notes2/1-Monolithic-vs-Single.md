# What's meant by monolithic versus a single cookbook?

## Monolithic cookbook

A monolithic means one source code control repository
is used to hold all the code.
you have one folder that is source controlled,
that is git controlled, and that has all the cookbooks.
So it has multiple cookbooks inside that repository.

## Single cookbook

A single cookbook method is,
it's each cookbook is an independent project.
So in Git you would have one Git repository
for cookbook 1, you'd have one git repository for cookbook 2.
